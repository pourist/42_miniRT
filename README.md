## Introduction

Welcome to miniRT, a C-based raytracer designed as part of the 42 curriculum, offering an introduction to the fascinating world of raytracing. Through miniRT, you'll not only explore how light interacts with objects in a virtual scene but also dive into the challenge of translating physical laws into code.
To develop this project, We follow TTD (Test-driven development) approach, using Criterion for the unit testing. An amazing source on raytracing that helped us a lot is [The Ray Tracer Challenge: a test-driven guide to your first 3D Renderer](http://raytracerchallenge.com/)

### About minTR

miniRT brings to life essential principles of raytracing, allowing users to create compelling scenes with simple geometric forms and adjustable lighting. From ambient to specular lighting, reflections, and refractions, miniRT’s core features lay the groundwork for generating images that capture realistic optical effect.

## How to use it

Only supported and tested on macOS and Linux.

For `Linux` it is necessary to install the GLFW library first:

```
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install libglfw3 && \
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
```

<b>Compile and run miniRT in 3 simple steps:</b>

1. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/SebasNadu/42_miniRT miniRT`
2. `cd miniRT && make`
3. `./miniRT scenes/bonus/04_skybox2.rt`

#### How to configure your own scenes

Your can read the scene [readme](./scenes/readme.rt) and use the [template](./scenes/template.rt) scene as reference. Have fun!.
